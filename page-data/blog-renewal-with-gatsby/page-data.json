I built my previous blog with jekyll. It was almost 4 years ago, and at that time, I wasnâ€™t a Front-End developer. So I did not know well about web technologies. (I was quite interested in web technologies though.) Now Iâ€™m working as a Front-End developer and wanted my personal sites looks better.</p>\n<p>Followings are skills that applied to build this blog.</p>\n<h3>Gatsby (React)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://gatsbyjs.org\">Gatsby</a> is a open source framework based on React to build your site as <em>static</em> files which is similar to jekyll. The reason I chose Gatsby is that it is based on React, which is I use everyday.</p>\n<p>And also it</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allows to use markdown files as articles.</li>\n<li>Provides many useful official plugins.</li>\n<li>Uses GraphQL. (I havenâ€™t used GraphQL, so wanted to experience how it works.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Gatsbyâ€™s blog starter</h3>\n<p>The skeleton of this blog site is forked from <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog\">Gatsbyâ€™s blog starter</a>. There are many starter Libs so that developers start to build right away without worries about boilerplate.</p>\n<p>The Gatsby CLI tool lets you install these starters like below.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\">gatsby new <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>SITE_DIRECTORY<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>URL_OF_STARTER_GIT_REPO<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<br />\n<p>With the blog starter, I remove some plugins I donâ€™t use, and modified some layout(Sidebar, Pagination and etc.).</p>\n<h3>Bootstrap</h3>\n<p>Bootstrap is widely used CSS framework and I also like it. I know basic of HTML and CSS but not an expert, so using this kind of CSS framework makes me build UI design fast and neat. Without Bootstrap, I might build UI like shit.</p>\n<h3>Google Fonts</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans\">Noto Sans</a> from Google Fonts is default font of this blog. There is no specific reason I chose the font. Just it looks alright. ðŸ˜‚</p>\n<h3>Google Analytics</h3>\n<p>This blog is not that popular or famous (ðŸ¥º), still I want to know how many people visited, and which post was useful.\nGatsby provides its official plugin for Google Analytics, so all I had to do was just inserting my GA tracking ID.</p>\n<br />\n<br />\n<p>Last year(2019), I wasnâ€™t active on this blog, but I look forward to writing more on it.</p>\n<p>Welcome to the twenties.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Blog renewal with Gatsby","date":"January 14, 2020","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog-renewal-with-gatsby/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/nginx-nodejs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Nginx - Configure Nginx as reverse proxy for Nodejs(Express)"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/react-state-persistence/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"React - custom hook for persisting state (usePersistedState)"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["426816048","63159454"]}
