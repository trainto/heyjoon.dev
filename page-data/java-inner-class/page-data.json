This reference makes the instances of the class larger, and may keep the reference to the creator object alive longer than necessary. If possible, the class should be made static.”</p>\n<p>It means simply if the inner class does not have references to outer class, consider to make it static.</p>\n<p><strong>Then why??</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Bloch\">Joshua Bloch</a> talks about various nested class through his book ‘Effective Java 2E’ - Item 22: Favor static member classes over nonstatic.
