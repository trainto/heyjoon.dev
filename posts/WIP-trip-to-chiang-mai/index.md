I don't remember exactly when my last trip was. Frankly speaking I don't want to remember. Anyhow for my first trip since covid 19 pandemic situation, I chose Chiang Mai, because I hoped the flight isn't too long, and I wanted to avoid too crowded cities, and it should be somewhere I've never been to.

Searched place to stay and some tourist attractions, made a rough daily plan, and I went on a 6 night trip.

I statyed [Anantara](https://www.anantara.com/en/chiang-mai) resort during my trip. I considered a slightly more affordable hotel, but decided to just enjoy this trip without being constrained by money. All the facilities were excellent, and the staff were very friendly, so I didn't experience any inconvenience during my stay.

I'm not particularly fond of this sort of activity, but since I had a quite long(6-night) stay, I thought it would be okay to try it for a day. We fed, walked with the elephants, washed them. The guides were knowledgable, taught us interesting facts about elephants. Honestly I wouldn't say it was fantastic or something, but quite decent experience .
