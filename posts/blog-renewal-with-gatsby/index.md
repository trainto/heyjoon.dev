title: 'Blog renewal with Gatsby'

Starting new year 2020, I decided to renew my blog. I built my previous blog with jekyll. It was almost 4 years ago, and at that time, I wasn't a Front-End developer. So I did not know well about web technologies. (I was quite interested in web technologies though.) Now I'm working as a Front-End developer and wanted my personal sites looks better.

Followings are skills that applied to build this blog.

### Gatsby (React)
[Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) is a open source framework based on React to build your site as *static* files which is similar to jekyll. The reason I chose Gatsby is that it is based on React, which is I use everyday.

And also it
- Allows to use markdown files as articles.
- Provides many useful official plugins.
- Uses GraphQL. (I haven't used GraphQL, so wanted to experience how it works.)

### Gatsby's blog starter
The skeleton of this blog site is forked from [Gatsby's blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog). There are many starter Libs so that developers start to build right away without worries about boilerplate.

The Gatsby CLI tool lets you install these starters like below.
```shell
gatsby new [SITE_DIRECTORY] [URL_OF_STARTER_GIT_REPO]
```

<br />

With the blog starter, I remove some plugins I don't use, and modified some layout(Sidebar, Pagination and etc.).


### Bootstrap
Bootstrap is widely used CSS framework and I also like it. I know basic of HTML and CSS but not an expert, so using this kind of CSS framework makes me build UI design fast and neat. Without Bootstrap, I might build UI like shit.


### Google Fonts
[Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans) from Google Fonts is default font of this blog. There is no specific reason I chose the font. Just it looks alright. ðŸ˜‚

### Google Analytics
This blog is not that popular or famous (ðŸ¥º), still I want to know how many people visited, and which post was useful.
Gatsby provides its official plugin for Google Analytics, so all I had to do was just inserting my GA tracking ID.

Last year(2019), I wasn't active on this blog, but I look forward to writing more on it.

Welcome to the twenties.
